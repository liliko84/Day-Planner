# Day-Planner

For the Day-Planner I startet creating variables for the current day,time blocks and the day.added the text content to the current day and for loop to format the time.Then I used moments to set the time ,whether it is present , past or the future.
made the variables and created the divs with the class of the time - blocks and hours, also the text area where we could enter the text that is needed for the day-plenner.all that we appended to the page.
At the end created the button to save the user input to the local storage.
